Impact: The web application hosted on our primary server experienced an outage, resulting in slow response times and partial unavailability for approximately 25% of our users.

Root Cause: An unexpected surge in traffic triggered a memory leak in the application code, causing the server to become unresponsive.

Timeline:

10:15 AM: Issue detected via a monitoring alert indicating elevated response times.
10:20 AM: Engineer on-call received alert, started investigating server logs for potential issues.
10:30 AM: Traffic patterns analyzed, initial assumption made about database overload.
10:45 AM: Further investigation revealed memory consumption increasing over time.
11:00 AM: Memory leak identified in application code after code review and profiling.
11:15 AM: Incident escalated to development team lead for code fix.
11:30 AM: Code fix implemented, server rebooted.
11:45 AM: Web application performance restored to normal.
Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the outage was traced to a memory leak in the application code. The surge in traffic led to increased memory usage, which eventually overwhelmed the server's resources, causing slow response times and partial unavailability. The memory leak occurred due to improper handling of a cache, causing data to accumulate and not get cleared properly.

To resolve the issue, the development team identified the specific code segments responsible for the memory leak. A comprehensive code review was conducted, and the cache management logic was revised to ensure proper clearing and optimization. After implementing the code fix, the server was rebooted, effectively restoring the web application's performance.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Code Review and Optimization: Conduct a thorough code review to identify potential memory leaks and optimize resource usage. Implement coding best practices for efficient memory management.

Monitoring and Alerting: Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to promptly detect unusual traffic patterns and resource utilization spikes. Set up alerts for memory consumption thresholds.

Load Testing: Regularly perform load testing to simulate traffic spikes and ensure the application can handle increased user activity without degrading performance.

Automated Testing: Implement automated testing for memory leaks as part of the continuous integration and deployment pipeline.

Documentation: Maintain detailed documentation on application architecture and troubleshooting steps to streamline future incident response.

Tasks to Address the Issue:

Patch Cache Management: Refactor cache management logic to ensure proper clearing and prevent data accumulation.
Automated Tests for Memory Leaks: Integrate automated tests to identify and prevent potential memory leaks.
Load Testing Routine: Establish a routine for regular load testing to identify performance bottlenecks.
Monitoring Enhancements: Fine-tune monitoring alerts to trigger based on memory consumption thresholds.
Incident Response Plan: Develop a comprehensive incident response plan for efficient handling of future outages.
In conclusion, the web server outage was swiftly identified and resolved through a systematic investigation, root cause analysis, and code fix. By implementing corrective and preventative measures, we aim to fortify our web application against future incidents, ensuring seamless user experiences and maintaining high availability.
